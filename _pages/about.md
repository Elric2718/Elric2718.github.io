Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a Biostatistics PhD candidate at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor [Haiyan Huang](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~hhuang/) and Professor [Peter J. Bickel](https://bickel.stat.berkeley.edu/). My research covers statistics, machine learning and data science. During my graduate study, I also did several interenships at Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. Prior to UC Berkeley, I completed a B.Sc. with honors in Mathematics at Tsinghua University.
